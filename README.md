# TOPIC: Rollback-Project

## Overview
> In this project, you will write a reusable command that rolls back changes. The current project is in continuation to the previous Project: Config and Deployment (InfrastructureCD in my repro).

## Rollback Deployment
> Rollback Deployment means, going back to the previous instance of the deployment if there is some issue with the current deployment.

## Prerequisites
> Key pair - You should have an AWS EC2 key pair. We are assuming the key pair name is udacity.pem.

> EC2 Ubuntu instance - You should have an EC2 Ubuntu instance running in your AWS account.

> CircleCI project - A public Github repository set up in the [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/). AWS Access keys and EC2 key pair (SSH key) must have saved in the CircleCI project settings.
