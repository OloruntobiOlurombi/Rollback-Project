# TOPIC: Rollback-Project

## Overview
In this project, you will write a reusable command that rolls back changes. The current project is in continuation to the previous Project: Config and Deployment (InfrastructureCD in my repro).

## Rollback Deployment
Rollback Deployment means, going back to the previous instance of the deployment if there is some issue with the current deployment.
